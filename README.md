1. Exploring and Navigating a Cloud-Hosted Cybersecurity Lab Environment
Overview

This project involved navigating a cloud-hosted virtual environment consisting of multiple Windows and Linux servers. The focus was on understanding network layout, system roles, and the tools required to conduct cybersecurity analysis.

Key Skills Demonstrated

Understanding enterprise network segmentation

Navigating Windows Server and Linux environments

Identifying system roles (DC, client workstation, server roles)

Preparing systems for security testing and analysis

CompTIA CySA+ Alignment

1.1 System and network architecture concepts

2.5 Vulnerability response and management

2. Configuring Security Controls
Scenario

Configured preventive, detective, directive, and corrective controls throughout the Structureality network. This enabled better mitigation of vulnerabilities and improved system security posture.

Tasks Completed

Implemented firewall rules

Configured Group Policy security settings

Controlled service behavior and permissions

Validated control effectiveness via testing

Skills Demonstrated

Security control identification and categorization

Hands-on configuration of server-based controls

Practical control validation

CySA+ Objectives

1.1 System & network architecture

2.5 Vulnerability response concepts

3. Reviewing Indicators of Compromise (IoC) & Threat Intelligence Sources
Scenario

Investigated and applied industry threat intelligence feeds, security baselines, configuration templates, and IoC repositories to strengthen organizational defenses.

Activities

Reviewed multiple IoC sources (IP-based, domain-based, hash-based)

Researched MITRE ATT&CK techniques

Analyzed CVE vulnerability repositories

Compared tactical, operational, and strategic intelligence sources

Skills Demonstrated

Threat intelligence sourcing

IoC categorization

Vulnerability baseline understanding

CySA+ Objectives

1.1, 1.4, 1.5, 2.5

4. Performing Threat Hunting
Scenario

Conducted threat hunting across multiple systems using logs, netstat, DNS analysis, and indicators discovered during investigations.

Tasks Completed

Identified suspicious IP connections from firewall logs

Detected malicious network activity via netstat

Performed scenario-based hunts for abnormal behaviors

Investigated DNS anomalies associated with command-and-control activity

Skills Demonstrated

Identifying suspicious network traffic

Endpoint-based threat hunting

Tracking observable IoCs (IP, process, DNS, ports)

Cross-system investigative triage

CySA+ Objectives

1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 3.2

5. Performing System Hardening
Scenario

Hardened systems by removing unnecessary components, updating essential services, and configuring stricter access and communication rules.

Activities

Managed Windows device drivers

Modified hosts file entries

Removed unnecessary services and software

Set custom firewall rules

Managed Linux file permissions

Skills Demonstrated

System hardening methodology

Iterative “remove & update” security cycles

Service minimization

File system permission management

CySA+ Objectives

1.1, 2.5

6. Configuring Automation for Security Operations
Scenario

Integrated threat intelligence feeds with system automation to improve response speed and reduce manual administration.

Automation Tasks

Automatically updated firewall rules based on malicious IP feed

Automated removal of malware using hash-based threat feed scripts

Implemented DNS resolution blocking using domain threat feeds

Skills Demonstrated

Security automation scripting

Threat intelligence feed integration

Scheduled task configuration

Automated remediation workflows

CySA+ Objectives

1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.5
